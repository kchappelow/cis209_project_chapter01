#Project Chapter 1

Population Projection.

The U.S. Census Bureau projects population based on the following assumptions:

*	One birth every 7 seconds
*	One death every 13 seconds
*	One new immigrant every 45 seconds

Task #1: Write a program to display the population for each of the next five years. Assume the
current population is 312,032,486 and one year has 365 days. 

*Hint*: In Java, if two
integers perform division, the result is an integer. The fractional part is truncated. For
example, __5__ / __4__ is __1__ (not __1.25__) and __10__ / __4__ is __2__ (not __2.5__). To get an accurate result with
the fractional part, one of the values involved in the division must be a number with a
decimal point. For example, __5.0__ / __4__ is __1.25__ and __10__ / __4.0__ is __2.5__.

Task #2: Run the program to make sure it works.

Task #3: Submit the homework using git.
